					<p>The data was collected in an email survey conducted by The Crimson during the month of August. Nearly 80 percent of the class responded (though not all of them finished the survey).</p>
					<p>Our presentation of the data assumes a random sampling and therefore discounts any selection bias that may exist.</p>

								<h2>Gender</h2>
								<p>Respondents were evenly split between men and women, with one respondent identifying their gender as other. The College announced last spring that 53.4 percent of the admitted Class of 2017 was male, a slight discrepancy that the press release attributed to a higher number of male applicants than female applicants.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div id="race" class="graph"></div>
								<h2>Ethnicity</h2>
								<p>In descending order, the ethnicities most represented in the Class of 2017 are white, Asian, Latino, African-American, Indian, Native American, and Pacific Islander. The College reported last spring that the admitted Class of 2017 is 19.9 percent Asian-American, 11.5 percent African-American, 11.5 percent Latino, 2.2 percent Native American, and 0.5 Native Hawaiian.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div id="athletes-raw"></div>
								<h2>Athletics</h2>
								<p>Recruited athletes represent 12 percent of the Class of 2017, and among non-recruited students, nine percent plan to walk on to a varsity team. Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships to its recruited athletes or give out merit scholarships of any kind.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div id="athletes-vs-race" class="graph"></div>
								<h2>Recruited Athletes by Ethnicity</h2>
								<p>Students of white or African-American ethnicities are overrepresented among recruited athletes. While white students make up 62 percent of the freshman student body, according to the survey, they make up 79 percent of freshman recruited athletes. On the other hand, recruited athletes of Asian descent are an underrepresented demographic. While Asian students constitute 25 percent of the freshman population, they make up just 13 percent of recruited athletes in the freshman class.</p>

								<div id="birth-order"></div>
								<h2>Birth Order</h2>
								<p>Oldest children constitute 38 percent of the incoming freshman class&mdash;the most represented birth order category. Youngest children came next at 30 percent, and middle children and only children each made up 16 percent of the class.</p>
							</li>

								<div id="school-type"></div>
								<h2>Secondary School</h2>
								<p>Sixty-one percent of surveyed freshmen said they attended a public high school, with the overwhelming majority of them at a non-charter school. Thirty-eight percent said they went to a private secondary school, with three quarters of those respondents saying they attended a non-denominational private school.</p>

In comparison, 10 percent of female graduating seniors and 9 percent of male graduating seniors surveyed by The Crimson last spring reported a starting salary below $30,000.</p>
										<p>At the upper end, three percent of female freshman respondents and nine percent of male freshman respondents said they anticipate earning more than $110,000 immediately after graduation.
