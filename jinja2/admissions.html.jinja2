        <p>Part II of The Crimson&#39;s Class of 2017 Survey examines admissions and financial aid at Harvard. According to reports from the survey, the average Harvard freshman receives financial aid, comes from a household that earns between $125,000 and $250,000 per year, and scored a 2237 on the SAT. Average standardized test scores varied by ethnicity and income, as well as varsity status&mdash;recruited athletes, on average, scored 173 points lower on the SATs than their non-recruited classmates.</p>
        <p>About 14 percent of the incoming freshman said their families earn above $500,000 per year, putting them among the top 1 percent of earners in the United States.</p>
