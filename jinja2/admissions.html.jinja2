        <p>Part II of The Crimson’s Class of 2017 Survey examines admissions and financial aid at Harvard. According to reports from the survey, the average Harvard freshman receives financial aid, comes from a household that earns between $125,000 and $250,000 per year, and scored a 2237 on the SAT. Average standardized test scores varied by ethnicity and income, as well as varsity status--recruited athletes, on average, scored TKTKTK points lower on the SATs than their non-recruited classmates.</p>
        <p>About 14 percent of the incoming freshman said their families earn above $500,000 per year, putting them among the top 1 percent of earners in the United States.</p>

However, surveyed freshmen anticipated playing for their entire college career at different rates depending on their status as an official recruit or a walk-on, with 93 percent of recruits intending to play all four years but just 47 percent of walk-ons planning to do the same.</p>

Of those who had been concussed, 19 percent reported that concussions had changed their approach or desire to play that sport while 5 percent of those who had not been concussed felt similarly. Repeated concussions have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative brain disease.</p>
