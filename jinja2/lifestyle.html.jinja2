        <p>From religion and politics, to drugs and alcohol, to mental health and technology, it is clear that the newest members of the Harvard community have much in common and plenty to disagree about. Part IV of The Crimson&#39;s freshmen survey takes a broad look at just what the members of the Class of 2017 do and believe.  Most of those surveyed are virgins, most consider themselves liberal, and most have an iPhone in their pocket, but a closer look at the more than 1,300 respondents&mdash;nearly 80 percent of the class&mdash;reveals a world of difference in the way freshmen lead their lives.</p>

                <p>When asked about their religious beliefs, a plurality of surveyed freshmen&mdash;22 percent&mdash;described themselves as Catholic. The next most popular religions, in descending order, were Protestantism, Judaism, and Islam. A combined 32 percent characterized themselves as atheist or agnostic, several points above the national average.</p>

                <p>Although 58 percent of surveyed  freshmen said they identify with a major religion, only 43 percent said they consider themselves in any way religious. Fewer still&mdash;24 percent of respondents&mdash;characterized themselves either religious or very religious. By contrast, 57 percent of Harvard&#39;s newest students said they are either not very religious or not religious at all.</p>

                <p>Catholicism was the most common religion among Northeasterners and Midwesterners, while Protestantism was the most popular religion among Southeasterners, Southwesterners, and Westerners.</p>
                <p>Of students surveyed from outside the United States, roughly half identified themselves as atheist or agnostic.</p>
                <p>In the Northeast, where two-fifths of respondents call home, 23 percent said they are Catholic, 17 percent said they are Protestant, and 14 percent&mdash;a figure twice as large as in any other region&mdash;identified as Jewish. Thirty-one percent of surveyed Northeasterners said they consider themselves atheist or agnostic.</p>

                <p>Students from lower- and middle-income families were more likely to identify as very religious than their wealthier peers. Students from households in the $250,000 to $500,000 a year bracket were most likely to call themselves not at all religious, and least likely to say they are very religious.</p>
