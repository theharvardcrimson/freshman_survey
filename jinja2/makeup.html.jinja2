        <p>Like most incoming Harvard classes, the Class of 2017 is among the College&#39;s most diverse ever. Men expect to earn more money than women do. Recruited athletes tend to identify as heterosexual and either white or African-American. And most of the class arrives in Cambridge as seasoned suburbanites, many of whom are intent on remaining in the Northeast. The Crimson’s survey of nearly 80 percent of the freshman class shows that while the College’s claims of diversity ring true, many of the fresh faces on campus flock together in a predictable fashion.</p>

                <p>Respondents were evenly split between men and women. The College announced last spring that 53.4 percent of the admitted Class of 2017 was male, a slight discrepancy that the press release attributed to a higher number of male applicants than female applicants.</p>

Twenty-nine percent of respondents identified as Asian or Indian, the second-greatest subset of the population. The College reported last spring that the admitted Class of 2017 is 19.9 percent Asian-American, 11.5 percent African-American, 11.5 percent Latino, 2.2 percent Native American, and 0.5 percent Native Hawaiian, with foreign students making up 10.3 percent of admitted students. </p>

                <p>Students of white or African-American ethnicities are overrepresented among recruited athletes. While white students make up 62 percent of the freshman student body, according to the survey, they make up 79 percent of freshman recruited athletes. Similarly, while African-American students constitute 10 percent of freshmen, they represent 13 percent of recruited athletes in the class. On the other hand, recruited athletes of Asian descent are an underrepresented demographic. While Asian students constitute 25 percent of the freshman population, they make up just 13 percent of recruited athletes in the freshman class.</p>
